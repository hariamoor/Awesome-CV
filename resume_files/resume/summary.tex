\begin{cvparagraph}
I am an undergraduate student at Rutgers University, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am currently pursuing a role as an entry-level software engineer.
\end{cvparagraph}

\begin{cvparagraph}
My area of interest in software is in backend and infrastructure-related products and processes. I love learning about different technologies, systems, and concepts in order to broaden my knowledge and perspectives as both a developer and an end-user of software. Therefore, I strive to pursue my academic interests in computer science, mostly in areas such as distributed systems, programming language theory, and network operations.
\end{cvparagraph}

\begin{cvparagraph}
A lifelong student in more ways than one, I am also a hobbyist in theoretical computer science and abstract math; I particuarly enjoy learning about complexity theory, algebra, and combinatorics. I see it as my duty and my privilege to continuously pursue mastery of different bodies of knowledge and contribute to human advancement in all analytical pursuits.
