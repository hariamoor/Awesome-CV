\begin{cvparagraph}
I am an undergraduate student at Rutgers University, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am currently pursuing a role as an entry-level software engineer.
\end{cvparagraph}

\begin{cvparagraph}
To date, I have completed multiple software engineering internships, most notably at Facebook in Menlo Park, CA and at MongoDB in New York, NY. My work at Facebook involved server-side processes for crash triaging of Android applications, while that at MongoDB involved various services and interfaces to provide support for high-volume and high-complexity OLAP workloads with the MongoDB query interface.
\end{cvparagraph}

\begin{cvparagraph}
My largest areas of interest in computer science are in distributed systems, programming language theory, and to a lesser extent in complexity and computability theory. In mathematics, I am also a hobbyist in algebra and combinatorics.
